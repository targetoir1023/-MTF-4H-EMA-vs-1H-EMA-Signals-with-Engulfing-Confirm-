# -MTF-4H-EMA-vs-1H-EMA-Signals-with-Engulfing-Confirm-

A sophisticated multi-timeframe trading indicator that combines the power of dual EMA analysis with precision entry signals. This indicator helps traders identify high-probability trading opportunities by analyzing the relationship between EMAs across two different timeframes while confirming entries with candlestick pattern validation.

The strategy is built around the concept of trend alignment - when shorter timeframe EMAs align with longer timeframe EMAs, it creates a confluence zone for stronger directional moves. The indicator not only identifies these alignment zones but also provides precise entry points with automatic risk management calculations.
