üìå Project Introduction

This project is a multi-timeframe EMA alignment and signal engine built for traders who want both clarity and precision when navigating trend continuation and reversals. It merges the structure of higher timeframe EMAs with the reactivity of lower timeframe EMAs, then adds candlestick confirmation through engulfing patterns‚Äîensuring that each signal is both trend-aware and price-action validated.

The script is designed not just as a static indicator, but as a dynamic decision framework: it identifies market bias, generates tiered trade opportunities, and instantly projects stop-loss and take-profit levels. This makes it a streamlined tool for swing traders and scalpers alike, combining multi-timeframe structure with tactical entry logic.

‚ú® Highlights

MTF EMA Framework (4H vs 1H): Trend bias confirmed using EMA alignment across higher and lower timeframes.

Engulfing Confirmation: Adds candlestick-based filtering to reduce noise and validate reversals or continuation setups.

Smart Signal Limiter: Restricts signals to 3 per EMA cycle for cleaner setups.

Primary vs. Continuation Entries: Clearly distinguishes fresh signals from continuation moves with unique markers.

Auto TP & SL Projection: Instantly plots reward-to-risk or percentage-based take profit and stop loss levels.

Visual Trend Bias: Live bias label (üöÄ Bullish, ‚òÑÔ∏è Bearish, Neutral) for quick chart sentiment recognition.

Cross Event Tracking: Highlights EMA crossovers as market regime shifts.
